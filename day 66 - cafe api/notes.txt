REpresentational State Transfer - REST


client -> server
http request to server (language used to make request)
or maybe ftp request (file transfer protocol)

http = French - ftp = Italian, basically make sure you use same protocol.

API is like a menu

REST = architectural style
baroque, gothic, neoclassical
architectural style for designing APIs

SOAP, GraphQL, Falcor - example of others

REST is gold standard

USE HTTP REQUEST VERBS
get, post, put, patch(new), delete
USE SPECIFIC PATTERN OF ROUTES/ENDPOINT URLs
